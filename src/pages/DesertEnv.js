          The Desert Environment is a hostile place for human survival due to temperature extremes and the scarcity—or absence—of water. Most deserts are either hot 
          and dry or cold and dry, and all typically receive less than 10 in (250 mm) of annual rainfall. They are areas of extremes, where heat exhaustion and 
          hypothermia are threats, and flash floods may rapidly replace dry conditions. A harsh place to survive, the desert should only be entered by those who 
          are prepared.

        <h3 className="desert_subhead">Desert Features</h3>
        <p className="desert_para">
          The popular depiction of a desert is of a dry, sandy landscape with searing skies and temperatures among the highest in the world. Such areas do exist, but 
          the desert environment has far greater diversity, from cold deserts in the polar regions to highlands, grasslands, and broken, rocky terrain that contain 
          "wadis" (seasonal stream beds).
        </p>

        <h3 className="desert_subhead">Surviving in the Desert</h3>
        <p className="desert_para">
          Hostile temperatures and few natural resources limit chances of survival in the desert. Water and shelter are scarce, if not non-existent, edible vegetation 
          is limited, and animals hide from the sun in the day. Wadis, grasslands, and higher ground all hold better prospects. The greatest dangers are dehydration 
          and heat exhaustion, although African savanna areas may be home to large, dangerous mammals. The main killers are big cats, hippos, rhinos, elephants, and 
          crocodiles.

        <h3 className="desert_subhead">Desert Essentials</h3>
        <div className="desert_para">
          <p>• Survival in the extreme conditions of the desert is impossible without full preparation. Consider the following:</p>
          <p>• Always prepare an EPA (Emergency Plan of Action) to notify someone of your plans before entering a desert area.</p>
          <p>• Water is life. Do not underestimate your needs; carry extra just in case, and carry equipment to maximize your chances of finding and procuring more 
          (binoculars, surgical tubing, filtration/purification pump) should the worst happen.</p>
          <p>• Ask local people about water sources that may not be marked on maps, such as wells used by Bedouin tribes.</p>
          <p>• If venturing into remote areas, augment your map and compass with a GPS, and consider taking a PLB (Personal Locator Beacon) or satellite phone.</p>
          <p>• If using a vehicle, ensure you carry jacking equipment for use in soft ground, sand mats or ladders for self-recovery, extra water, a shelter, location 
          aids, and any relevant vehicle spares.</p>
          <p>• Plan cut-off or safety points into your journey that can be used to divert to in case of emergency.</p>
          <p>• Ensure you know how to accomplish emergency repairs to your vehicle.</p>
          <p>• Ask local people about known dangers, such as impassable roads, misleading tracks, and soft-sand areas.</p>
          <p>• When using a ladder for self-recovery, tie it to the back of the vehicle so that it is dragged behind once crossed, and can be retrieved when you reach 
          solid ground.</p>
          <p>• If your vehicle breaks down, leave it only if staying is no longer safe or feasible—rescuers will search for it first.</p>
