          The Temperate zones are the two regions between the Tropic of Cancer and Arctic Circle, and the Tropic of Capricorn and Antarctic Circle. 
          Typified by seasonal variations in climate, conditions can include baking hot summers, freezing cold winters, and rainfall all year round. 
          Landscape features range from forests and snow-covered peaks to grasslands and deserts. Although most temperate regions are highly populated, 
          don't be lulled into a false sense of security—a worst-case scenario can still arise just a few miles from help.

        <p className="temperate_para">
          Although they contain a wide range of environmental features, the temperate zone's typical feature is forest, ranging from deciduous trees 
          that shed their leaves in fall to coniferous trees that retain their leaves all year round. Grassland predominates where forests have been cleared, 
          while highland areas contain hills and mountains. The abundance of rain means that rivers and lakes are common, and swampy wetlands form in areas 
          with poor drainage.

        <div className="temperate_para">
          <p>Climate and terrain can vary widely in temperate areas, so preparation for a range of eventualities is essential:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Don't underestimate the temperate environment. Although the vast majority of the human race lives in temperate zones, the diversity of terrain 
              and weather means that survival equipment and knowledge must be broad enough to cope with a wide range of situations and conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Temperate weather can change very quickly, so check the local forecast before you set off, and carry a small AM/FM radio so you can listen to 
              local weather reports.
            </li>
            <li>Plan a realistic and achievable route, and prepare an EPA (Emergency Plan of Action). Be ready to re-assess your route during the trip.</li>
            <li>Take clothing for the full range of conditions you may encounter.</li>
            <li>Carry a survival kit, knife, emergency equipment, cell phone, and first-aid kit, and know how to use them.</li>
            <li>Carry some form of basic shelter, even if only going out for the day.</li>
            <li>Always take a map and compass, and consider using a GPS as an aid.</li>

        <h3 className="temperate_subhead">Surviving In Temperate Areas</h3>
        <p className="temperate_para">
          Most temperate environments have a relatively mild climate and good natural resources, making them favorable places for long-term survival. 
          Water can be found in most areas, wood for building shelters and lighting fires is usually abundant, and different types of edible plants 
          and animals can be found at different times of the year if you know where to look. Potentially the greatest threat is hypothermia, a particular 
          problem in cold, wet, and windy conditions especially in winter and at night, when temperatures tend to fall even further.
        </p>

        <h3 className="temperate_subhead">Wildlife And Plant Life</h3>
        <p className="temperate_para">
          Plant and animal life can be abundant in temperate areas and represents both a valuable food resource and a potential hazard. 
          Shoots and stems, leaves, roots, nuts, or berries of some plants are edible, but only with positive identification or at the least, 
          the Universal Edibility Test. Small mammals, birds, insects, reptiles, and fish can also be found but may be difficult to catch and kill, 
          and must be prepared and cooked properly. Wildlife can also pose a threat—snakes, spiders, and scorpions may bite and, though rare, bears, 
          wolves, and cougars may attack if cornered.
