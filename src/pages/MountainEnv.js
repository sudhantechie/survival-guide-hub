          The Mountain Environment is one of the harshest places for humans to survive. Defined as landmasses with a summit above 2,000 ft (600 m), mountains can be 
          very dangerous places due to their elevation and terrain. Lower temperatures and poor weather are more likely at higher altitudes, so there is a significant 
          risk of hypothermia, frostbite, and altitude sickness, while snow, ice, and precipitous terrain present further hazards. Survival may depend on your ability 
          to descend to areas with better prospects of survival and rescue.

        <h3 className="mountain_subhead">Mountain Features</h3>
        <p className="mountain_para">
          Above the treeline, mountain terrain is typically barren, featuring bare rocks, gravel, boulders, and snow and ice, which are most extensive during the 
          winter but may persist at high elevations during the summer. At lower levels, coniferous forest is the predominant feature, dissected by streams and rivers 
          fed by snowmelt. Topographical features include scree slopes, cliffs, ravines, boulder fields, snow slopes, and glaciers.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mountain_subhead">Elevation Change</h3>
        <p className="mountain_para">
          Mountains of sufficient height may have vastly different ecosystems at different elevations due to harsh conditions at high altitude. Plant and animal life 
          varies at different elevations, so the natural resources available for survival will differ according to height. Mixed deciduous trees are common on low 
          slopes, and conifers grow at intermediate levels, but thin out to grass, isolated shrubs, moss, and lichen higher up. At the highest levels, high winds, 
          snow, frost, and ice discourage any growth. One of the most dangerous animals in mountain areas is the cougar, also known as the puma, panther, or mountain 
          lion. Found in North and South America, more than 20 percent of attacks are fatal.

        <h3 className="mountain_subhead">Surviving in the Mountains</h3>
        <p className="mountain_para">
          The prospects for survival are good at lower elevations, where trees provide material for shelter and fire, rivers provide water, and edible plants and 
          animals are likely to be present. At higher elevations, vegetation is scarce, so there are fewer options for shelter and food, although water from streams 
          or snow is likely to be available. There may be a risk of avalanche on snow-covered slopes, and crevasses pose a hidden danger in glaciated areas. 
          Cold-related injuries pose the greatest threat.
        </p>

        <h3 className="mountain_subhead">High-Level Hazards</h3>
        <p className="mountain_para">
          The primary threats to survival at high altitude are cold-related ailments, the most dangerous of which is hypothermia. This occurs when the body's core 
          temperature falls below 95°F (35°C)—if allowed to drop as low as 86°F (30°C), it can be fatal. Frostbite may also occur in the extremities in freezing or 
          cold and windy weather, and can lead to permanent tissue damage. Altitude sickness, which can cause pulmonary or cerebral edema—and in extreme cases, 
          death—is also a risk above 8,000 ft (2,500 m).
