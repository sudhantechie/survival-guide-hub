          Potentially the most harsh and challenging of all environments, the sea is unlike any other due to the lack of the most essential requirements for human life—fresh water. Around 70 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by saltwater, ranging from the freezing, wind-torn polar oceans to the warm tropical seas. Winds and currents govern your movement, protection is limited, and natural resources are virtually nil, so reaching land is your best hope for survival.
        </p>

        <h3 className="marine_subhead">Marine Features</h3>
        <p className="marine_para">
          The marine environment ranges from the coastal margins, which are shallow enough—650 ft (200 m) or less—to support a huge array of animal and plant life, to the open oceans, the deepest of which plunge to more than 33,000 ft (10,000 m). There are sharks in every ocean, but those in tropical waters are the most aggressive. Around 20 of the hundreds of species have attacked humans, and the most dangerous types are the great white, tiger, and bull sharks.

        <h3 className="marine_subhead">Surviving at Sea</h3>
        <p className="marine_para">
          Natural resources in the open ocean are virtually nil, so improvising shelter or location aids is limited to what you have with you. Seasickness, especially in a small liferaft, can seriously affect your ability to remain both hydrated and motivated. Unless you can reach land, your only drinking water will come from rain or mechanical desalination devices—consuming urine or saltwater will only increase your rate of dehydration. Reaching land or shipping lanes greatly increases your chances of rescue.

        <h3 className="marine_subhead">Marine Essentials</h3>
        <ul className="marine_para">
          <li>Pack sea-survival equipment as if your life depends on it—it might! Other environments allow you to improvise survival and location aids, but not the sea.</li>
          <li>Take emergency immersion-survival suits. They will protect you against the elements and aid flotation, and their color (high-visibility orange or red) is an aid to location.</li>
          <li>Always carry a PLB (Personal Locator Beacon), just in case.</li>
          <li>Take several means of obtaining water, such as a reverse-osmosis pump (turns saltwater into drinking water), a saltwater desalination kit, a solar still, and rain catchers.</li>
          <li>
            Always keep a pre-packed emergency bag handy. It should contain:
            <ul>
              <li>First aid kit</li>
              <li>Reverse-osmosis pump</li>
              <li>Emergency beacon</li>
              <li>Solar still</li>
              <li>Water</li>
              <li>Flares</li>
              <li>Fishing kit</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If your vessel sinks, do not abandon it until absolutely necessary. Stay nearby unless it is unsafe to do so—anything that gives you a bigger "survival footprint" will increase your chances of being rescued, and you may be able to retrieve provisions from the vessel.
          </li>
          <li>
            If imminent rescue is unlikely, you will need to ration your water. Consider how much you have, how much can be procured, the chances of seasickness (which leads to dehydration), and the likelihood of being rescued later on.
          </li>
          <li>Protect yourself from the elements (sun, wind, cold, heat, and salt) as well as you can—prevention is better than cure.</li>
          <li>
            The sea, especially in rough conditions, can sap the will to live quicker than any other environment. Seasickness is literally draining, resulting in lost fluid, energy, and motivation. Take anti-seasickness tablets at the earliest opportunity—even before abandoning ship—so that you can keep them down, and keep taking them as recommended.
